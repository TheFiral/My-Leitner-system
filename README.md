# My-Leitner-system
I have made this app for myself. I often learn English words using the Leitner system.
But cardboard boards sometimes annoy me. And I thought I can make this app so that I can learn an English word on my phone, by my own algorithm

The app have 3 function:

  1)First of them, you can add some word with English and Russian translated.
  
  2)Second of them, when you added some words, the words save in DB of new words for learning. And you can learn their in "learn new words". 
  This function have algorithm where every words have counter for strike.
  When the counter have strike in 4, word be learned and it saving in DB for learned words.
  Also when the counter have strike in 0 and 2, you are translating with Russian on English, else you are translating with English on Russian.
  
  3)Last function, you are checking words that you learned earlier.
